An example that shows how the Spherical Harmonic Approximation works

# %% [markdown]
# # Example of using Spherical Harmonic Approximation
#
# This example illustrates the inner workings of the Bluemira spherical harmonics
# approximation function (spherical_harmonic_approximation) which can be used in
# coilset current and position optimisation for spherical tokamaks.
# For an example of how spherical_harmonic_approximation is used
# please see,
#
# ## Premise:
#
# - Our equilibrium solution will not change if the coilset contribution
# to the poloidal field (vacuum field) is kept the same in the region
# occupied by the core plasma (i.e. the region characterised by closed fux surfaces).
#
# - If we constrain the core plasma while altering (optimising) other aspects
#   of the magnetic configuration, then we will not need to re-solve for
#   the plasma equilibrium at each iteration.
#
# - We can decompose the vacuum field into Spherical Harmonics (SH)
#   to create a minimal set of constraints for use in optimisation.

# ### Flux Function at collocation points within LCFS
#
# The steps are as follows:
#
#
# 1. Select collocation points within the LCFS for the chosen equilibrium.
#
#
# 2. Calculate psi at the collocation points using interpolation of
#    the equilibrium vacuum psi.
#
#
# 3. Construct matrix from harmonic amplitudes and fit to psi at collocation points.
#
# #### 1. Collocation points
#
# There are currently four options for collocation point distribution:
# - 'arc' = equispaced points on an arc of fixed radius
# - 'arc_plus_extrema' = 'arc' plus the min and max points
#    of the LCFS in the x- and z-directions (4 points total)
# - 'random'
# - 'random_plus_extrema'
#
# N.B., the SH degree that you calculate up to should be
# less than the number of collocation points.
#
# In the plot below the collocations points are shown as
# purple dots, and the LCFS is indicated by a red line.

# %%
# Number of desired collocation points excluding extrema (always 4 or +4 automatically)
n = 50

# Create the set of collocation points for the harmonics
collocation = collocation_points(
    n,
    original_LCFS,
    "random_plus_extrema",
)

# Plot

x_plot = grid.x
z_plot = grid.z
nlevels = 50

plot1.plot(x_bdry, z_bdry, color="red")
plt.show()
print("number of collocation points = ", len(collocation.x))

# %% [markdown]
# #### 2. Flux function at collocation points
# N.B. linear interpolation is default.

# %%
# Set up with gridded values from chosen equilibrium
psi_func = RectBivariateSpline(eq.grid.x[:, 0], eq.grid.z[0, :], vacuum_psi)

# Evaluate at collocation points
collocation_psivac = psi_func.ev(collocation.x, collocation.z)

# %% [markdown]
# #### 3. Construct and fit harmonic amplitudes matrix
#
# Construct matrix from harmonic amplitudes called 'harmonics2collocation'
# (rows = collocation, columns = degrees).
#
# For each collocation point (r, $\theta$) and degree calculate the following:
#
# $$ A_{l} = \frac{ r_{collocation}^{(l+1)} }{ r_{typical}^{l} }
#           \frac{ P^{1}_{l}cos(\theta) }{ \sqrt(l(l+1)) } $$
#
# Fit to psi at collocation points using 'np.linalg.lstsq'.
# This function uses least-squares to find the vector x that
# approximately solves the equation a @ x = b.
# Where 'a' is our coefficient matrix 'harmonics2collocation',
# and 'b' is our dependant variable, a.k.a, the psi values
# at the collocation points found by interpolation 'collocation_psivac'.
#
# Result is 'psi_harmonic_amplitudes', a.k.a., the coefficients necessary
# to represent the vacuum psi using a sum of harmonics up to the selected degree.
#
# In our case, the maximum degree of harmonics to calculate up to
# is set to be equal to number of collocation points - 1.

# %%
# Typical length scale
r_t = np.amax(x_bdry)
# max_degree is set in the bluemira SH code but we need it here
max_degree = len(collocation.x) - 1

# Construct matrix from harmonic amplitudes for flux function at collocation points
harmonics2collocation = harmonic_amplitude_marix(collocation.r, collocation.theta, r_t)

# Fit harmonics to match values at collocation points
psi_harmonic_amplitudes, residual, rank, s = np.linalg.lstsq(
    harmonics2collocation, collocation_psivac, rcond=None
)

# %% [markdown]
# ### Selecting the required degrees for the approximation
#
# Choose the maximum number of degrees to calculate up to
# in order to achieve a appropriate SH approximation.
# Below we set plot_max_degree = 4 as a test.
# You can change the number to see what will happen to
# the plotted results.
#
# In the next section, we will calculate a metric that can be used
# to find an appropriate number of degrees to use.

# ### Calculate Coil Currents and Find the Appropriate Degree to calculate up to
#
# psi_harmonic_amplitudes can be written as a function of the current distribution
# from the coils outside of the sphere that contains the LCFS.
# As we already have the value of these coefficients,
# we can use them to calculate the coil currents.
#
# We can then calculate an approximate value of the vacuum psi,
# and compare the LCFS from our starting equilibria to the LCFS
# of our the equilibria calculated from our SH approximation.
# This will allow us to choose the maximum degree necessary
# for an appropriate approximation.
#
# The steps are as follows:
#
# 1. Construct matrix from harmonic amplitudes and calculate
#   the necessary coil currents using the previously calculated
#   'psi_harmonic_amplitudes'.
#
#     - Construct matrix from harmonic amplitudes called
#       'currents2harmonics' (rows = degrees, columns = coils).
#       For each coil location (r, $\theta$) and degree calculate the following:
#       $$ A_{l} = \frac{\mu_{0}}{2} (\frac{r_{typical}}{r_{coil}})^{l} sin(\theta)
#       \frac{ P^{1}_{l}cos(\theta) }{ \sqrt(l(l+1)) } $$
#
#     - Calculate the coil currents using 'np.linalg.lstsq'.
#       This function uses least-squares to find the vector x
#       that approximately solves the equation a @ x = b.
#       Where 'a' is our coefficient matrix 'currents2harmonics',
#       and 'b' is our dependant variable,
#       a.k.a, the psi harmonic amplitudes .
#
#
# 2. Calculate the total value of psi, find the XZ coordinates of the associated LCFS
# and compare to the original LCFS.
#
#     - The fit metric we use for the LCFS comparison is as follows:
#         fit metric value = total area within one but not both LCFSs /
#                                      (input LCFS area + approximation LCFS area)
